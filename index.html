        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12"><img src="./Website resources/article-what-Is-customer-service.jpg" height="200px" alt="csr"><p>I've spent a few years in a call centre. I can honestly say this was hands down the most challenging position I've ever had. Even the lowliest customer service agent must be an island of stability, dependability and professional knowledge for dozens of customers a day. I learned a lot from this position and came away completely unafraid of making phone calls, haha.</p>  </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12"><img src="./Website resources/starbucks.jpg" height="200px" alt="barista">"I've spent the next few years making coffee. At the time I thought I was going to make it big in comedy, so I was content making a decent sum of money in return for flexible hours. Alas, I failed to become a household name and was forced to seek more meaningful employment. On the plus side, I now make a mean cappuchino." </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12"><img src="./Website resources/CNC 2.jpg" height="200px" alt="cnc">"After I left the coffee shop, I took it upon myself to learn a proper trade and upskilled into CNC machining. This has been the most relaxing of all my positions, with my boss being my only customer. The factory's been good to me, but I feel I need to make an even bigger skill upgrade if I want to have any semblance of career growth." </div>
